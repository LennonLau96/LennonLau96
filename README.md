- 👋 Hi, I’m @LennonLau96
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, operating systems (especially driver for RTOS) and hardware, following the example of Zhihui Jun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of single chip microcomputer, and my major is computer-biased deep learning. After working, I am engaged in the related work of intelligent cockpit and intelligent platform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on intelligent cockpit and intelligent hardware platform.
- 📫 You can reach me through my email.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Life is full of hope and fun! Enjoy it!
